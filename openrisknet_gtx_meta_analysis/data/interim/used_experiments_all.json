To this purpose, we designed an in vitro protocol based on the generation of neural rosettes, representing the in vitro counterpart of the developing neural plate and neural tube, and we challenged this complex cell model with retinoic acid (RA), a well-known teratogenic agent. The cells were exposed to different concentrations of RA during the process of rosettes formation. Morphological and molecular parameters were evaluated in treated as compared with untreated cells to detect both cytotoxicity and specific neural toxicity. Transcriptomic analysis was performed with microarray Affymetrix platform and validated by quantitative real-time PCR for genes relevant to early neural development such as HoxA1, HoxA3, HoxB1, HoxB4, FoxA2, FoxC1, Otx2, and Pax7. The results obtained demonstrated that neural rosette forming cells respond to RA with clear concentration-dependent morphological, and gene expression changes remarkably similar to those induced in vivo, in the developing neural tube, by RA exposure. This strict correspondence indicates that the neural rosette protocol described is capable of detecting specific teratogenic mechanisms causing perturbations of early neural development and therefore represents a promising alternative test for human prenatal developmental toxicity.", "Submission Date :": "2012-03-13", "Factor Name :": "compounddose", "Compound :": "DIMETHYL SULFOXIDETRETINOIN", "Measurement Type :": "Transcription profiling", "Technology Type :": "DNA microarray", "Technology Platform :": "Affymetrix", "Link to Sample Information :": "click", "Link to Data Files :": "click", "Link to ArrayExpress :": "click", "Link to Atlas :": "click"}, "DIXA-028": {"InternalId :": "DIXA-028", "Source Id :": "Predictomics", "Project :": "Predictomics", "Title :": "Genomic profiling of the selected list of test substances (hepatotoxins)in human cultures.", "Description :": "The overall goal of this study is to identify biomarkers of drug-induced chronic liver toxicity (steatosis and cholestasis) by means of genomics technology. In a first step, we have evaluated the suitability of primary human hepatocytes as in vitro model to identify gene expression changes relevant to chronic liver toxicity. In particular, we have measured gene expression changes in primary human hepatocytes upon incubation in monolayer culture for five periods of time: 1h, 14 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h.In a second step, we have searched for steatosis- or cholestasis-associated gene products by measuring gene expression changes induced by an overload of human liver HepG2 cells with either fatty acids (FFAA) or taurocholate respectively. In particular, we have measured gene expression changes upon treatment with two concentrations of FFAA (1 mM and 2 mM) and one of taurocholate (5 mM) at two time points (14 h and 24 h). In a third step towards the identification of relevant steatosis biomarkers, we have measured gene expression changes by treatment of HepG2 cells with the drugs Tetracycline (100 uM), Valproate (125 uM) and Amiodarone (12.5 uM) for a period of 24 h", "Submission Date :": "2007-12-31", "Factor Name :": "AgeCompoundDoseDose DurationDose FrequencySample TimePointCompound2Dose2", "Organ :": "liver", "Strain :": "PHH (BH-609)HepG2", "Compound :": "CHEMBL8659CHEMBL224867CHEMBL1440CHEMBL633CHEMBL109", "Measurement Type :": "transcription profiling", "Technology Type :": "DNA microarray", "Technology Platform :": "Affymetrix", "Link to Sample Information :": "click", "Link to Data Files :": "click"}, "DIXA-029": {"InternalId :": "DIXA-029", "Source Id :": "UKK-4", "Project :": "Esnats", "Title :": "Human skin-derived stem cells as a novel cell source for in vitro hepatotoxicity screening of pharmaceuticals.", "Description :": "Human skin-derived precursors (hSKP) are postnatal stem cells with neural crest properties that reside in the dermis of human skin. These cells can be easily isolated from small (fore)skin segments and have the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types. In this study, we show that upon exposure to hepatogenic growth factors and cytokines, hSKP acquire sufficient hepatic features that could make these cells suitable in vitro tools for hepatotoxicity screening of new chemical entities and already existing pharmaceutical compounds. Using a toxicogenomics approach, we could demonstrate that hSKP-HPC respond to acetaminophen exposure in a comparable way to primary human hepatocytes in culture. The toxicological responses liver damage, liver proliferation, liver necrosis and liver steatosis were found to be significantly enriched in both in vitro models. Also genes associated with either cytotoxic responses or induction of apoptosis was commonly up regulated and might represent future molecular biomarkers for hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, our data gives a first indication that hSKP-HPC might represent a suitable preclinical model for in vitro screening of hepatotoxicity.
