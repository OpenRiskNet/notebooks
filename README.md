# OpenRiskNet Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter and Squonk notebooks developed for and with the 
[OpenRiskNet VRE](https://home.prod.openrisknet.org/).

As far as I know, folowing case studies also have their own repositories at gitlab:
1. https://gitlab.com/bayjan/openrisknet_magkoufopoulou  
2. https://gitlab.com/bayjan/openrisknet_sysgroup  

3. Genotoxicity prediction meta-analysis:  
  a. https://gitlab.com/bayjan/gtx_meta_analysis  
  b. https://gitlab.com/bayjan/openrisknet_meta_analysis_data   
  
  3a and 3b are part of the same case study, but 3b contains mostly data and; thus, pretty big. So, I couldn't upload it to GitHub due to 50Mb max file size limit.
